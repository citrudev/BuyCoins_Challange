# BuyCoins_Challange
Using the GraphQL Hub API (https://www.graphqlhub.com/playground), recreate the front page of Hacker News (https://news.ycombinator.com/)

What you SHOULD include:
1. The responsive design of the website. Make your recreation as close to the real website as possible
2. The top 30 stories on the front page

What you should NOT include:
1. Any other page than the front page. You should not try to recreate the individual story pages, or anything else
2. Any functionality on the site such as upvoting. I only want you to recreate the content, not the functionality of the front page.
